Open Band Parameters Device Simulator (OBPDS)
=============================================

A free, open-source technology computer aided design software for simulation
semiconductor structures and devices.

The plan is to begin by providing 1D, zero-current electrostatic simulation of
III-V compound semiconductor heterostructures, similar to Prof. William
Frensley's `Bandprof`. Next, drift-diffusion current simulation will be added
under the assumption of small band discontinuities. Then large band
discontinuities will be accounted for with thermionic emission boundary
conditions.

Materials parameters are provided by the `Open Band Parameters` sister
project.

The `source code`_ and `documentation (coming soon)`_ are graciously hosted by GitHub.
